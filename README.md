#F5 in the "open world" of Github, Automation and OrchestrationThe nature of the IT industry is one of constantly emerging and refining #processes and trends. A trend that has taken the IT world by storm is the emergence of DevOps, a production philosophy that unifies the #concept of experimentation and iteration with a measure of control to ensure stability. To implement the DevOps concepts, IT groups #require more powerful and extensive tools to carry out their job like Github, Jenkins, Docker, Puppet/Chef/Ansible. In this session, we #will review how F5 works on expending its solutions to help and support DevOps teams.
